## Usage
### Development Mode
To start the development server and launch your React application, run the following command:

This will generate an optimized and minified version of your application in the build directory. The production build is suitable for deployment to a web server or hosting platform.

You can run tests for your React components using the following command:

npm test

This will execute the tests using the configured test runner.
